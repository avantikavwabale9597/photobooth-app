Why I made it:
So basically it's my second electron project and i want to make something which is useful for evryone and also to learn more about Electron JS. It's a beginner friendly project so it's very easy project!!

How I made it:

1.Firstly you must need nodejs and npm in your device if not install it according to your needs

2.then run "npm init -y" to intialise the project

3.As it's electron project run "npm install electron --save-dev" to install electron. (You always need to run this command when you are making new elctron project. Run this in your project folder)

4.You're done here with installations now just make files "index.html, styles.css, renderer.js" These are the main file where you write your code

5.also make "main.js" This is very IMP file as this file loads your electrin window ans also initialise it in your "package.json" file

Now you're done just write your codes in main file and there you go you will make your first desktop app using ElectronJS!!

To run it just run "npm start"
